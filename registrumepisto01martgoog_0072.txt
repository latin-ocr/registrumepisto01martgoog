his letters confirm this. The consecration took place,
according 1ο Wikes, “ Dominiea Media Quadragesimae‚”
· that is, on March 11101 March 16, according 10 Whar-
ton. Wharton¹ also gives the date “prima Dominica
“ Quadragesimae 'f (19 Feb.) as resting on some authority,
and translates this as being 3Non llart. These two ⁸
Sundays fall on the dates Wharton gives when Easter
is on April 16, but according to the tables in Nicolas'
“ Chronology 01 History,'' Easter fell on April 2 in 1279.
Perhaps Wharton ascribed these evenis 10 the preceding '

' 1011070110111010·0101111117. The date 01

consecrationis statedin Le Neve's Fasti Eccleaioe Angli-
0010 10 have been 6 March, but it is clear from the
‹lates 01 two documents in the Register,2 the first dated
“ viii. Kal. Martii, anno Domini 10011111, consecratio·
“ nis vero anno prim0,'’ and the next, “ v. Kal. Martii,
“ consecrationis nostrre anno secund0,'' that the year of
consecration began between 22 and 25 Feb.² probably on
13101. The peges 01 the Registerare frequently headed,
and documenta dated “anno ordinationis‚” that is
from the date 01 the bull ; and sometimes it appears that
the scribe has begun the year 01 consecration too early
hy confusing it with the year 01 ordination. That at
least is the only way 01 reeoneiling apparently erroneous
dates, as that 01 No. cxlviii.
