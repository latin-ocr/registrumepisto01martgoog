Though the names oi the persons to whom the letters
are addressed are usually given, names oecurring in the
body of the letters are frequently represented by initials,
not always those of the real name, or by the word
“ talis,'’ while dates mentioned in the text are similarly
treated. These omissione and alterations have been
supplied and corrected from the Register. The compel-
latione are generally abbreviated here, and in some of
the letters printed in the following pages, which were
transcribed from this MS„ this form has been retained,
as the extension seemcd needless.

This manuscript is for the most part very carefully
written. lt has boen of very great use in determining
the reading of passages in the Register which were
oliseuro either from faded ink or mutilation‚ but it has
not been thought necessary to give the readings where
the two MSS. differ, except in a few cases.

ham, arc a few which are of a later date and have there-
fore not been printed. Of these the most importantarc—
