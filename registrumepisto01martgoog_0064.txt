Index, much of it in Mores's haudwriting, in Add. MS.
6111. The epitome follows the order of the MS. through·
out Add. MS. 6112 contains a title-page and drafts
of the Latin prefaee, with a specimen printed page (f. 59).
At f. ll are notes of the documents printed by wilkins
and Rymer, and et ff. 32 and 38 a few other memoranda

In Add. MS. 261186, a volume of transcripte collected
by Sir Francis T. Palgrave‚ there are copies of five
documents in the Register·.¹

' 1>oe uuuuu ts Dr. David wilkins, who was a predecessor of Ducarel
Bm] in the Library, used this Register, as he did others, in
compiling his “ Concilia Magnae Britanniae ct Hiberniae,''
published in 1737: The documents printed by him have ’
been reprinted here, firstly, because from their impert
auce it was not desirable to omit them, or merely to
refer to another book; secondly, because, whether from
errors in copying or printing, there are numerous mis·
takes in the Concilia3 and thirdly, became the order
in which wilkins has placed his extracto does not
always follow the true chronology.

A few documents from the Register are else included
in Rymer's “Fredere” Margiual references are given
to both these publications.

The whole of the contente of the Register will not
he found in the following pages, as most of the formal
documents heve been omitted. Itis intended iu an

appendix to a future volume to give au epitome of what
it has not been thought advisable to print in full in
the text. It will be seen from the account of the MS.

at p. xlii. thet the documents were entered in the Re·
gister under headS, not in chronological order, but they
have been printed throughout according to date, the
reference tc their place in the MSS. being given in the

margin, R. signifying the Register, aud A the All
Souls MS.
